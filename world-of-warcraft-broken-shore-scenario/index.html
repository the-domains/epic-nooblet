I first did it with one of my Horde characters, then I subsequently did it again this time with an Alliance character. I really love how everything was setup, I love the collaboration of the Horde and Alliance (I mean finally!), but…</p><p>So for those that haven’t played it, beware of SPOILERS! You have been warned!</p><p>I’ll admit I wasn’t entirely expecting everything that happened. I knew there were big changes coming, but I never really did expect for the leaders of both factions to die. Now although I primarily play a Horde character these days, I have to admit to my heart being with the Alliance always. Watching Varian Wrynn get killed by Gul’dan kind of sucked. I kept hoping that he would somehow be saved, but I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.</p><p>But watching it from the Alliance side was even worse. I spent the whole time (both times) really enjoying the dynamic between Varian and Sylvanas. It finally seemed like things really were the way the should be when something is threatening Azeroth as a whole. The relationship between the two was beyond civil, it was downright amicable, and I loved it! However, when you play from the Alliance side you suddenly feel completely betrayed. It is only then that you realize that the Alliance had no vantage point from which they could see what was happening to the Horde, they couldn’t see that Vol’jin had been mortally wounded, or that Thrall was also losing. They couldn’t hear Vol’jin ask Sylvanas to not let the Horde be lost that day. Instead all the Alliance sees is that suddenly Sylvanas calls a retreat, with no explanation. From their point of view the Horde just abandoned the Alliance to their fate. Betrayed them. It wasn’t clear from Varian’s expression whether or not he realized that the Horde had lost and was being overrun, or if he even truly believed that Sylvanas had betrayed him just moments after they had wished each other luck and offered each other help.</p><p>Safe to say the whole scenario, particularly from the Alliance POV, actually left me feeling heart broken. Mainly Wrynn’s death. While I thought it also sucked that Vol’jin died, I personally felt no real connection to him. On the Horde side I only play blood elves, and although on the Alliance I am primarily night elves, Wrynn has been at the forefront of the story for far longer. I think it ultimately was a much bigger loss for the Alliance. It probably would have been more of an equivalent loss if Thrall had died, though that would bring another whole host of issues.</p><p>So anyway… What I’ve been trying to say with all of this is that if you have any intention of playing Legion, you definitely should not miss the Broken Shore Scenario.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">World of Warcraft: Broken Shore Scenario</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

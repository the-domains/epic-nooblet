            <title><![CDATA[Cosplay - Inquisitor Progress]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cosplay - Inquisitor Progress</h1><p>So I’ve basically been working on the Inquisitor cosplay for what seems like an eternity now (I know, I’m terrible at this). I think that part of the problem is that I wanted to do something fairly complicated as my first cosplay. Now mind you, I do think that my choice is easier than the default Inquisitor outfit, but it’s still challenging and involves a lot of sewing.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3f509e93-1808-4866-951b-988aa9d619fe.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Giving up WordPress...maybe?</h1><p>So I’m still debating whether to fully migrate my site to this experimental Grid site.

# Cosplay - Inquisitor Progress

So I've basically been working on the Inquisitor cosplay for what seems like an eternity now (I know, I'm terrible at this). I think that part of the problem is that I wanted to do something fairly complicated as my first cosplay. Now mind you, I do think that my choice is easier than the default Inquisitor outfit, but it's still challenging and involves a lot of sewing.

Now...where to start...? It all began with a concept art video for Dragon Age Inquisition. I fell in love with one of the armor concepts they showed and I decided that I wanted to cosplay as that. For some reason I deemed that it wouldn't be as complicated as it would appear. Here's the image that started it all:

I don't know what it was, but out of all the concepts this one just called out to me. Why I thought it was simple I have no idea. So I did get as far as finishing the coat for this, although it wasn't ideal, it didn't fit quite right and I was sort of winging some of the design as this was the only image I had to go by.

Eventually the game released, I never did finish this concept. However, as I played the game I found the version of this that ended up being my favorite:

Though not entirely simpler, it does have less overall armor. It doesn't have the iconic Inquisitor chest piece with the symbol, but even though I do have that armor in the playthrough this screenshot was taken from, this is still by far my favorite. As you can surmise from this I play a rogue Inquisitor, and the less heavy armor the more sense it makes to me. The type of moves that I have seem like they would benefit from the lighter, soft armor than they would from the metal gauntlets and chest cover.

So, I mentioned something about progress didn't I? Well I have made more progress. I'm currently working on the pattern for the vest, and I'm almost done sewing the pants. I might rework them again, but for the first try they fit rather well and I was pretty impressed. Don't get me wrong, they could be better, but they are currently good enough for me to move on to another piece. Also one of the biggest things, is that I was able to find all the fabric I needed to finish this. The toughest things to find so far had been the suede for the coat and the leather for the boots and gloves. Apparently dark brown suede with no pattern isn't easy to find...go figure. Why suede you ask? While it is true that it's obvious that most of these textures are leather, the particular leather I chose to use (in-game) looked very clearly more like suede when I looked at it up close. Aside from the fact that I really like the look of this in-game, I also determined it would be an easier fabric to work with for the purposes of the cosplay.

So I'll leave you with a preview of the pants so far and the beginnings of the vest pattern. My husband has also done me the favor or starting to work on my blades, though that is still in more experimental stages.

# Giving up WordPress...maybe?

So I'm still debating whether to fully migrate my site to this experimental Grid site. Originally I didn't want to because this still had some kinks to be worked out. However, recently my WordPress site is being excessively slow, and no matter what I do I'm unable to post to it from my phone app, which is what I wanted. 

Moving it over to The Grid would allow me that without any problems. Their systems are very well integrated to the app which would make it easier for me to keep up with posting. As it stands right now, there is a post on my WordPress app that's going nowhere. I don't feel like re-writing the entire thing, but the gist of it was that I will probably be primarily writing posts from my phone going forward. 

When I'm on my computer I never seem to get around to updating or writing a new post. I'm either playing games or editing video and keep thinking I'll do it later and then I never do. Later I remember I was supposed to and by that point and not by my computer, but I am usually by my phone. So to my delight I had found the WordPress app which I should have been able to get to work with my WordPress installation, but...it's not...

Should I decide to fully move over to The Grid, I will be moving some (probably not all) my posts from my WordPress site. Some I don't think are as relevant anymore. The other thing I like about moving over to the grid is how easy it is to post my videos here. I can share directly from YouTube to here and it will generate the post for me. 

So...stay tuned...!
